        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add 150 g water to the keema. Mash the keema with water until it
              forms a slurry. This prevents it from clumping when cooked.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mix cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, Kashmiri red
              chili powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl, and keep it ready.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Finely chop onions, ginger, garlic, and green chilies.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Heat mustard oil in a kadai. Temper it with bay leaves until
              aromatic.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Then, add the finely chopped onions and sauté on medium heat for
              10 minutes until brown.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add ginger and fry for 1 minute. Now, add the mix of powdered
              spices that you prepared earlier.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Fry until the raw smell of the spices is gone. Add a splash of hot
              water from time to time to sauté the spices. Make sure to keep
              adding water when the pan dries out, and continue frying.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Sauté the mixture on medium heat until oil separates. This should
              approximately take 6–8 mins.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now lower the heat and add the keema slurry. Break any remaining
              lumps.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Turn up the heat and dry off the excess water. Add garlic. Adding
              it towards the end gives the keema a nice garlic-y flavor.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add gorom moshla and ketchup, and continue cooking until the
              mixture is completely dry. Add amchur powder and mix well. Now,
              discard the bay leaves and turn off the heat. Finally, add bhaja
              moshla, green chilies, and 50 g breadcrumbs.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mash the keema with your hands so that it can be molded around the
              egg. If the mixture is too wet, add more breadcrumbs. If it is too
              crumbly, add some beaten egg.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Divide the mixture into 60 g portions and flatten across your
              palm. Place half a boiled egg on it, flat side down. Now, mould
              keema around the boiled egg. Egg devils should ideally be oval,
              egg-shaped. So try and maintain that shape throughout this stage.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For breading, in three separate dishes, take breadcrumbs, plain
              flour (maida), and beaten eggs. Season each of them with some
              salt.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We will double-bread the devils to get a substantial, crisp crust.
              For that, first, lightly dust the devil in flour. This step will
              prevent the crust from sliding off the filling later.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Next, dip it in the egg and shake off the excess. Then, roll it in
              breadcrumbs, pressing them on, so that they stick to the egg.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Repeat the previous step once again: that is, dip the devil in egg
              and then breadcrumbs for a second time.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              [Throughout this process keep your 'dry' and 'wet' hands separate,
              such that you handle the eggs (wet) with your left hand, and flour
              and breadcrumbs (dry) with your right hand. Reverse this if you're
              left-handed. This is to avoid the clumping of the dry
              ingredients.]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Heat vegetable oil and deep-fry the devils on medium heat (oil
              temperature: ~170°C), until they are evenly brown on all sides.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Serve hot with kasundi, and a salad of sliced onions, cucumber,
              and beetroot.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
