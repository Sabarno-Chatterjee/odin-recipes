        Description: Sha Phaley, a beloved Tibetan street food, is a culinary
        delight that combines the crunchiness of deep-fried bread with a
        flavorful meaty filling. The dough for the bread is rolled out thinly,
        stuffed with a savory mixture of ground meat, onions, and sometimes
        cabbage, then folded and sealed before being deep-fried to golden
        perfection. The result is a crispy and golden exterior, revealing a
        deliciously moist and spiced filling within. Sha Phaley is often enjoyed
        as a snack or appetizer, reflecting the rich and diverse flavors of
        Tibetan cuisine. The combination of textures and flavors makes it a
        favorite among locals and those fortunate enough to discover this
        culinary gem. Ingredients:

        Preparation:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prepare a dough using all-purpose flour and water, then roll it
              out into thin rounds or ovals.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In a bowl, mix ground meat, finely chopped onions, cabbage (if
              using), ginger-garlic paste, soy sauce, salt, and pepper to create
              the filling.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Place a portion of the filling onto one half of the rolled-out
              dough and fold the other half over it, sealing the edges to form a
              pocket.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Deep-fry the stuffed dough pockets in hot oil until they turn
              golden brown and crispy.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Remove from the oil and let excess oil drain on a paper towel.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Serve Sha Phaley hot, either on its own or with a dipping sauce of
              your choice.
