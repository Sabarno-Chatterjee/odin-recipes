        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>2 litre milk, full cream</li>
          <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
          <li>1 cup sugar</li>
          <li>5 cup water</li>
          <li>3 pod cardamom</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Firstly, in a large vessel get 2 liters of milk to a boil,
              stirring occasionally.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Once the milk comes to a boil, pour 2 tbsp lemon juice and stir
              well. You can alternatively use curd or vinegar.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Stir until the milk curdles, keeping the flame on low to medium.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Do not boil further once water separates completely.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Drain the curdled milk over a cloth-lined colander. You can use
              the leftover water to make soup or knead the dough as they are
              very nutritious.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Squeeze off the water completely. Be careful as the curdled milk
              will be very hot.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Rinse off the curdled milk with fresh water to remove sourness
              from lemon juice.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Squeeze off the water completely. Do not over squeeze as the
              moisture in paneer will be lost.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hang for 1 hour, making sure the water is drained completely, yet
              retain the moisture.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>After 1 hour, start to mash the paneer for 5 minutes.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mash the paneer until it turns out a smooth texture without any
              grains of paneer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now prepare small ball-sized paneer and keep aside. Cover and keep
              to prevent from drying.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In a large vessel, take 1 cup of sugar, 5 cups of water, and 3
              pods of cardamom.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Stir and dissolve the sugar completely.</p></li>
          <li><p>Now boil the water for 5 minutes.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Drop in rolled paneer balls one by one into the boiling sugar
              water.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Cover and boil for 10 minutes or until rasgulla doubles in size.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now drop into ice-cold water immediately to prevent from shrinking
              in size.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Once cooled completely, take into a serving bowl and pour in the
              leftover sugar water.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Finally, enjoy rasgulla chilled or as it is.</p></li>
