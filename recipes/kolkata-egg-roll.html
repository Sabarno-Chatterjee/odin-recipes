          <li>4 pcs green chillies</li>
          <li>1 large lime</li>
          <li>1–2 tsp chaat masala</li>
          <li>1–2 tsp rocksalt</li>
          <li>80 g tomato ketchup</li>
          <li>1 pc cucumber (optional)</li>
          <li>~ 75 g vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Wrap:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>300 g maida (flour)</li>
          <li>6 g salt</li>
          <li>14 g sugar</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For the outer paratha/wrap, add the flour, salt, sugar, and dalda
              to a mixing bowl. Combine the ingredients until the fat is well
              dispersed in the flour. Take your time and rub the flour between
              your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs in texture. This will
              lead to a flakier crust.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Now add the warm water and knead the dough for about 5 minutes
              until it is soft and smooth. Coat it with oil, cover the bowl, and
              allow it to rest for 30 minutes.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, mix together finely sliced onions, chopped green
              chillies and the juice of half a lime. Pickling the onions in lime
              juice reduces their sharpness. If using cucumber, peel it and
              remove the central seeds. Then chop them into thin matchsticks.
              Create an assembly station where you gather all the items required
              for the filling. This will allow you to easily put together the
              roll once the paratha is off the stove.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Back to the dough: once it has rested, divide it in 130 g
              portions. For an extra-flaky exterior, we will roll the dough in
              the lachcha paratha style, incorporating layers of flour and oil.
              To do this, form a ball and roll it out to a disc about 12 cm
              large. Apply a thin layer of oil on the surface and sprinkle some
              dry flour. Make an incision on the disc along a radius and roll it
              in the shape of a cone [WATCH THE VIDEO]. Press down to flatten.
              Rest the dough for about 5 minutes to relax it again, after which
              roll it for a second time to disc 22 cm in diameter.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Beat an egg with a pinch of salt and keep at the ready.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Heat about 4 tsp oil (12 g) in a flat frying pan or skillet. Add
              the paratha and fry it on both sides until golden. Rotate the
              parathacontinuously, flipping often, for a uniform crust. Pay
              special attention to the sides to ensure that they crisp too. Once
              the parathais completely cooked, spread the beaten egg over it.
              Before it settles, turn over to fry the side with the egg.
              Transfer it to the assembly station, with the egg side facing up.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Sprinkle it with chaat masala and rocksalt. Add a row of the
              pickled onions a little off the centre of the paratha. Squeeze
              some lime juice over it. Top it with cucumber if you like. One of
              our favourite variations of the egg roll is the egg-potato roll.
              If we have it on hand, we like to add some leftover spicy alu’r
              torkari as well. Finish everything off with a few squirts of
              ketchup.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Form a tight roll, making sure the filling is all enclosed within
              the paratha. Wrap a paper around two-thirds of the roll and tuck
              any excess at the bottom.
