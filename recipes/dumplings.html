                Dumpling are usually steamed, though they are sometimes fried or steam-fried. 
                Meat or vegetables fillings becomes succulent as it produces an intensively flavored broth sealed inside the wrappers.

            <h3>Steps:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <u>Wash and clean the chicken</u>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Wash and clean the meat, then take a pan and add in all these ingredients in a large sauce pan to simmer over low heat, until the chicken is done. Then remove the chicken and remove the skin. While the chicken is cooking, make the dumplings.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Knead a dough</u>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Put flour into a mixing bowl and stir in salt. Work in shortening as you would when making pie crust, using two knives or a pastry cutter. Add egg, working it into the dough. Then stir in cold water gradually, until the dough comes together and is at a stage where you will be able to roll it out.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Cook the dumplings in the broth</u>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Lightly flour a surface and roll out the dough to a pie shell thickness (about 1/8 inch). Using a cutter, cut the dough into 1/2 to 1 inch squares. Finally, put the squares into the chicken broth and cook until done (about 30 minutes).
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Serve hot</u>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Return the chicken to the soup with the dumplings to cook another 15 minutes or until you have a gravy texture. After you get a gravy texture, it's ready to serve.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
