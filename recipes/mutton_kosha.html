        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For the marinade, add 100 g quartered onions, 5 g roughly chopped
              garlic, 100 g yoghurt, 15 g salt, turmeric, and shahi garam masala
              to a grinder jar. Blitz to form a smooth paste.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Coat all the mutton pieces with the marinade, making sure to get
              into all the nooks and crannies of the meat. Cover and allow the
              mutton to marinate in the refrigerator for about 8 hours.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Coming to the prep: Cut 400 g onions into thin slices. For this
              recipe, sliced onions define the texture of the curry. Diced,
              chopped, or puréed onions won’t give you the same result. Using a
              mortar and pestle, crush together 10 g garlic and 20 g green
              chillies to a paste. For ease while stirring later on, you may
              also cut all the bay leaves in 3-cm sections using a pair of
              scissors.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Heat a large kadai and add mustard oil to it. Once the oil has
              started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow, add
              the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, green cardamom,
              black cardamom, and cloves.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add the onions and fry them on medium flame for about 15 minutes
              until they are light brown in colour. Then, add the ginger paste,
              and garlic and green chilli paste, and fry for another 5 minutes.
              Keep the flame medium to low, depending on whether your onions are
              sticking to the pan or not, and stir often. We want to fry the
              spices as well as develop colour on the onions. Next, add the dry
              spices (coriander, cumin, and red chilli) mixed with 100 g of
              water. Continue frying the onions along with the spices for about
              15 more minutes. By now (it’s been 30 minutes since we started),
              your onions should have taken on a reddish-brown colour and the
              spices started releasing their oils.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add the marinated mutton to the pan. The mutton has been in the
              fridge, so it is cold. Raise the heat and mix everything
              thoroughly. Fry the mutton, stirring frequently to check that it’s
              not sticking to the pan, for 15 minutes on high heat. Beat 150–200
              g yoghurt until it is lump-free and add it to the pan. Also add 8
              g salt and 10 g sugar at this point. Mix everything and keep
              frying. Once the moisture (from the cold mutton and yoghurt)
              starts to dry out, drop the heat to medium.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There’s not much to it now. On medium heat, for the next 75 to 90
              minutes, repeat the following steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Add a splash of hot water to the pan (~30 ml at a time)</p>
              </li>
              <li><p>Stir it in</p></li>
              <li><p>Cover the pan and cook for a minute</p></li>
              <li><p>Uncover and stir everything thoroughly</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              What we’re doing here is a kind of controlled browning. Stir,
              scrape, and incorporate any of the browned bits that may have
              stuck to the bottom of the pan, as that is what will allow the
              mutton to develop a rich colour. However, be alert so that the
              gravy doesn’t burn and turn bitter. Keep adding water a little at
              a time and cooking the meat in the gravy.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Once you are happy with the colour, add as much water as you’d
              like for the gravy/curry. Also add about 4 slit green chillies for
              flavour. Cover and cook until the mutton is tender. You should be
              able to tear it apart with two fingers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Turn off the heat and top off with a little bit of ghee. Cover and
              let it rest for about 2 minutes before serving.
            </p>
