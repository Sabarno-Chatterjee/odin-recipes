        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            500 gms Chicken Mince (I made chicken mince with boneless chicken in
            mixer grinder)
          </li>
          <li>1 medium Potato (arnd 150 grams) (Boiled)</li>

          <li>3 large Eggs</li>
          <li>300 gms Bread crumbs</li>

        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              In a large bowl add chicken mince, boiled potato, lime juice,
              grated ginger, grated garlic, chillies, coriander leaves, chilli
              powder, black pepper powder, garam masala powder, and salt and mix
              and combine everything well with hands and keep the marinated
              chicken mince aside.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              While the chicken is resting, let us get the rest of the things
              ready. Beat the eggs in a flat dish and spread the bread crumbs in
              a large plate.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              I made 6 super large chicken cutlets with this amount of chicken.
              But you can make 12-14 small cutlets.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now it is time to shape the cutlets. Take a ball of the marinated
              chicken mix, slowly flatten and shape them into a thin diamond or
              square shaped cutlet or as per your desire (traditionally Bengali
              chicken cutlets are diamond-shaped) and coat them with a thin
              layer of bread crumbs. Follow this procedure until all the chicken
              mix is used up.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now carefully dip the shaped chicken cutlets in the egg and coat
              them well.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Place it carefully on the plate of bread crumbs and coat it
              uniformly with it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              At this point, you can pack it and place it in the freezer to fry
              and enjoy later.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Heat oil in a frying pan or skillet and fry the chicken until
              crispy and golden brown on both sides.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Serve it with Kasundi or tomato ketchup along with a side of
              salad.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
