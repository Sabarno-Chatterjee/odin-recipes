      <h3><u>Tips</u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For juicy and tender meat balls, soak chicken in lukewarm water for
          about 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make Chicken Manchurian, marinate the chicken for at least 1 hour
          and then fry it.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you do not have chicken stock ready, don't worry, as you can use
          water as well for the gravy.
        </li>
        <li>
          For making a healthier dish, you can also grill or bake the chicken
          balls instead of deep frying them.
