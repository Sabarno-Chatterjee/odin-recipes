              Dumplings are bite-size dumplings made with a spoonful of stuffing
              wrapped in dough. Dumpling are usually steamed, though they are
              sometimes fried or steam-fried. Meat or vegetables fillings
              becomes succulent as it produces an intensively flavored broth
              sealed inside the wrappers. Dumpling is an important dish for
              Tibetans and Nepalese , both for everyday and festivals. Variants
              of the dish developed later in Nepal after it became popular among
              Asians.

            <p>
              Butter Chicken, also known as chicken makhani or traditionally as
              murgh makhani, is an Indian curry made with a base of a spiced
              tomato gravy with plenty of butter (makhan) and marinated chicken
              that's typically cooked in a tandoor. It's famous for its bold
              red-orange color, silky smooth creamy texture, and rich flavors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala, although similar, are not
              the same dish! Butter Chicken has its origins in India and uses
              more butter, while Chicken Tikka Masala is a British dish with a
              more concentrated tomato flavor.

            <p>
              Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated
              chicken chunks (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce. The sauce is
              usually creamy and orange-coloured. The dish was first offered by
              British cooks of south Asian origin and subsequently gained
              popularity at restaurants around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute
              it to the South Asian community in Great Britain; some sources
              also cite Glasgow as the city of origin. Chicken tikka masala may
              derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian
              subcontinent.

              Tandoori chicken is a South Asian dish of chicken marinated in
              yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay
              oven. The dish is now popular world-wide. The modern form of the
              dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi in
              the late 1940s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, or as a
              main course, often served with naan flatbread. It is also used as
              the base of numerous cream-based curries, such as butter chicken.
              Local varieties of tandoori chicken prepared from the rooyi posto
              in Bengal have appeared in local eateries, particularly those
              between Kolaghat and Kolkata.

              Mutton kosha is an iconic Bengali delicacy. The word kosha is
              similar in meaning to bhuna, which involves slowly cooking a gravy
              over low flame for a very long time to get a rich, dark-brown
              gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces. It is worth pointing
              out that in Bengal, as well as in India, mutton is commonly used
              to refer to goat’s meat. Mutton kosha (or kosha mangsho) can be
              served with porota or polao. It tastes great even with plain rice.
              One of the most famous shops selling this style of mutton kosha is
              Golbari at the Shyambazar crossing in Calcutta.

              India and chicken rezala lives up to its name. This mildly spicy
              with a slight sweetness rezala is a rich and thick white chicken
              gravy very much like a korma but much more. Chicken rezala is
              perfectly paired with parathas. But you can also serve it with
              rice, pulao or roti.

              one or half an egg encased in a spicy wrapping. The outer wrapping
              is usually potato for egg devil sold in street-side stalls in
              Calcutta. In cabins or older dine-in cafes/restaurants, the egg is
              wrapped in minced meat cooked with spices. Finally, the whole
              thing is coated in breadcrumbs or in a batter, and deep-dried.
              Dim'er devil is served with kasundi, and a simple salad of onions,
              cucumber and beetroot.

              It is believed that the pound cake is of northern European origin
              and dates back to the early 1700s. A recipe for pound cake appears
              in The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse, published in 1747. The
              first U.S. cookbook, American Cookery, published in 1796, has a
              recipe for pound cake.

            <p class="name">Chicken 65</p>
            <p>
              Chicken 65 is a spicy, deep-fried chicken dish originating from
              Hotel Buhari, Chennai, India, as an entrée, or quick snack. The
              flavour of the dish can be attributed to red chillies and curry
              leaves, but the exact set of ingredients for the recipe can vary.
              It is prepared using boneless chicken and is usually served with
              an onion and lemon garnish.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Chicken 65 is well established as being the invention of
              A. M. Buhari of the Buhari Hotel chain, its popularity as a dish
              has spawned several myths about its origin and name. One account
              claims that the dish emerged as a simple meal for Indian soldiers
              in 1965. Another account claims that it is a dish containing 65
              chili peppers devised by an enterprising hotelier.

            <p>
              Bengali chicken cutlet is made with minced chicken. This is unlike
              a chicken schnitzel or an escalope, where the whole breast is
              breaded and deep-fried. In the case of the Bengali style chicken
              cutlet, the chances of the meat drying out are also minimal. It is
              typically found in most old Calcutta cabins. A cabin menu is
              literally incomplete without a chicken cutlet. And quite often, it
              is known as fowl cutlet.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is also quite popular during Durga Pujo. Most of the Durga
              puja pandals have food stalls selling fish fry, chicken roll and
              chicken cutlet.

              Korma has its origins in 16th century India, with Mughal
              antecedents. Regions in India have all evolved their own korma;
              the common underlying characteristics being a rich creamy curry.
              Korma is not traditional to Chettinad but one finds a delicious
              avatar – based on a wet masala paste of cashew nuts, various
              seeds, and green chillies, worked into a mild curry base of
              coconut, onion, tomato, and cardamom. This rich, flavourful egg
              curry recipe was earlier reserved for festive occasions, but is
              now made often and relished in the region.

              Kalia and korma are the two pillars of Mughlai cuisine. korma has
              a base of ghee—water even if it is added for cooking is eventually
              dried off. Kalia, in contrast, is water- or milk-based and the
              final dish is runnier. Korma is for special occasions, while kalia
              is more of an everyday preparation. Of course, this kalia, and
              other Bengali kalias, are heavily modified from the original
              Mughal kalia—which were not as fiery. These probably developed
              under the Nawabs of Bengal incorporating local ingredients and
              tastes.

              nuts, shredded coconut, and other toppings.
