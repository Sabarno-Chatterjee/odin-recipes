            <p>
              Dumplings are bite-size dumplings made with a spoonful of stuffing
              wrapped in dough. Dumpling are usually steamed, though they are
              sometimes fried or steam-fried. Meat or vegetables fillings
              becomes succulent as it produces an intensively flavored broth
              sealed inside the wrappers. Dumpling is an important dish for
              Tibetans and Nepalese , both for everyday and festivals. Variants
              of the dish developed later in Nepal after it became popular among
              Asians.

              Mughlai paratha (or moglai porota as it is called in Calcutta) is
              a flaky, refined-flour pastry filled with a mixture of beaten
              eggs, keema, spices, and seasoning. It differs from other stuffed
              porotas in that the filling, runnier than other porota fillings
              because of the beaten eggs, cooks inside the porota. Making a
              moghlai is not difficult, but it does take a fair bit of planning.

            <p>
              Butter Chicken, also known as chicken makhani or traditionally as
              murgh makhani, is an Indian curry made with a base of a spiced
              tomato gravy with plenty of butter (makhan) and marinated chicken
              that's typically cooked in a tandoor. It's famous for its bold
              red-orange color, silky smooth creamy texture, and rich flavors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala, although similar, are not
              the same dish! Butter Chicken has its origins in India and uses
              more butter, while Chicken Tikka Masala is a British dish with a
              more concentrated tomato flavor.

            <p>
              Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated
              chicken chunks (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce. The sauce is
              usually creamy and orange-coloured. The dish was first offered by
              British cooks of south Asian origin and subsequently gained
              popularity at restaurants around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute
              it to the South Asian community in Great Britain; some sources
              also cite Glasgow as the city of origin. Chicken tikka masala may
              derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian
              subcontinent.

            <p>
              Tandoori chicken is a South Asian dish of chicken marinated in
              yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay
              oven. The dish is now popular world-wide. The modern form of the
              dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi in
              the late 1940s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, or as a
              main course, often served with naan flatbread. It is also used as
              the base of numerous cream-based curries, such as butter chicken.
              Local varieties of tandoori chicken prepared from the rooyi posto
              in Bengal have appeared in local eateries, particularly those
              between Kolaghat and Kolkata.

            <p>
              Mutton kosha is an iconic Bengali delicacy. The word kosha is
              similar in meaning to bhuna, which involves slowly cooking a gravy
              over low flame for a very long time to get a rich, dark-brown
              gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces. It is worth pointing
              out that in Bengal, as well as in India, mutton is commonly used
              to refer to goat’s meat. Mutton kosha (or kosha mangsho) can be
              served with porota or polao. It tastes great even with plain rice.
              One of the most famous shops selling this style of mutton kosha is
              Golbari at the Shyambazar crossing in Calcutta.
